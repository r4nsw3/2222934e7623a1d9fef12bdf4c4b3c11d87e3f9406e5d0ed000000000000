----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:
   
My true self cannot be with you...


Plucked straight from the pages of an ancient fairy 
tale, The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince tells the 
story of two lonely hearts brought together through a 
mutual misunderstanding. 

Transform between the wolf and the princess to solve 
puzzles and evade traps, collect flowers and petals to
unlock fragments of memories, and weave through the 
dark and dangerous forest to guide the prince toward a
cure. 

But be warned...an all-seeing forest is no place for a 
blind prince.
